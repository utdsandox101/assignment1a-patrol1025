# Create a function called: calculate_avg_grade
# Parameters: the function should receive 1 parameter: a list of student objects
#             Remember a list can contain duplicates, so you can expect two student objects with same ID but different grades
# Returns: the function should return a dictionary with student ID as key and student average grade as value
#
# Example:
# input: [Student('s1',20,1824,90.5), Student('s2',21,1823,80.0), Student('s1',20,1824,70.0)]
# output: { 1824: 80.25, 1823: 80.0 }
#
# If the list of students is empty, return an empty dictionary
# Make sure that you add type hints to the function paramter and return value
